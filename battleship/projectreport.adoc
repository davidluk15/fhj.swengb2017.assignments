== Project Team
Our team consists of two members *Lukas David* who is the team leader and *Alexander Horina* and it is called Jägermeister. +
[%hardbreaks]
We split our project in two main parts *organization* and *coding*. 
Due to the small size of our team we decided that both team members are involved in every part of the project.
[%hardbreaks]
Because only two people work on this project we decided that we will not need something like scheduled formal meetings. Instead we will do most of our communication with slack and only meet when there is a special reason to do so.

|===
As mentioned before our project is divided in two main categories organization and coding and every task is in one of these two categories. Like we can see above the coding part has with 64 hours more than twice the size as the organization part which has only 31 hours.  
[%hardbreaks]

Combined they result in a total sum of *95 hours* which is the estimated time for our whole project.

== Cost Calculation
For the project cost calculation we decided to charge 15€ for one working hour.
So when we estimate with 95 hours the costs for our project will be *1425*€.
[%hardbreaks]

The price for our product will be 5€. We choose this price because we think that for a simple battleship game you can't charge that much, because it isn't a game that is very unique or new, because there are already so many battleship games around. 
[%hardbreaks]
1425/5 = *285*
[%hardbreaks]
So 285 games will be the breakeven point for our project. This means we need to sell 285 games to cover the costs of the project and for every game we sell after the first 285 games we will make a profit.


== Mockups
All our mockups are designed with Balsamiq Mockups 3. We kept them in black and white because we wanted to focus on the functionality of our game first and afterwards we will design a pretty looking GUI. 

=== Splash Screen


.Splash screen

This page also has a "Return" button to bring you back to the main menu.

This is the edit screen where the players place their ships. At the top there is a list where you see the remaining ships and their length. You can decide if you want to place the ship vertical or horizontal and then you have to set the X and Y Position and click "Place"

[%hardbreaks]
On the right side you see an graphical illustration of your placed ships. When every ship is placed you can click "Next" to enter the battlefield or you can return to the main menu.

In this window finally we see the actual game. At the top there is the game name which is generated from a list and the player name. On the left side we have a log where you can see if a player missed or hit a ship.
[%hardbreaks]
On the right side there are a few buttons. "New game" brings you back to the screen where every player chooses his name. It is also possible to save and load a game or to go back to the main menu.
[%hardbreaks]
On the right upper part we see a status log. There we see the ships remaining and how often they have been hit by a player.
